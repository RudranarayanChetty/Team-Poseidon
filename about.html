                <p>
                    Overfishing, driven by the insatiable demand for seafood, has depleted many marine species to alarming levels.
                    This practice disrupts the natural food webs in the ocean, causing a decline in the populations of many marine species,
                    ultimately disrupting the entire marine ecosystem.

                <h2>Detailed Project Description</h2>
                <p>
                    Poseidon takes input from the user as text, and in the future, we plan to incorporate a Google Lens-like feature as well.
                    It provides basic details about endangered marine species and links to the SAR Public registry for more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our plans for the future include incorporating Computer Vision and Machine Learning Models for species identification
                    and updating the database with new species and status for more regions.

                <p>
                    When we started working on the topic, we wanted a database that has information about the geographical region in which the species are found.
                    We used NASA's "Critical Habitat of Species at Risk" dataset and the Government of Canada's dataset on aquatic species listed under Species at Risk Act
                    to create a centralized platform for species information, water quality, and climate change data.

                <h2>Hackathon Journey</h2>
                <p>
                    Our team was concerned about the environment and marine life. The data provided by NASA inspired us to create Poseidon,
                    a platform for all conservation needs, from providing information about species to water quality and SAR status.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are now working on creating more databases for other locations as well.
